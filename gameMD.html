<p><strong>The Game MD</strong> implemented a <strong>grid layout</strong> for their website. 
    This website uses <strong>responsive</strong> design. There is no content 
    that is not visible from one view to another, only the way the content is displayed. The 
    background-image used on the landing screen has a max width, and is no longer the background-image
    at the 770px breakpoint. This image will have a 100% width at the 441px breakpoint. It is at this same
    770px breakpoint that we see the site go from multiple columns to a single column layout.
