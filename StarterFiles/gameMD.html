              <img src="img/gamemdlogo.svg" alt="Game Cycle"></h3>
            <p><strong>The Game MD</strong> implemented a grid layout for their website.
              It is obvious that this website was designed for mobile users.
              They have also decided that communication between them and their customers
              is a priority to them as they have made all forms of communication visible on 
              every page via the footer. The landing screen has a couple buttons that either
              call the store, or lead you to their Facebook page.

            <h3>Desktop View</h3>
            <p><strong>What I Like: </strong>I am a fan of how they made customer interaction a priority. 
              There are several form of communication being displayed to the user on every page. I also like
              information is easy to find, and prices for repairs are visible on the website, rather than customers
              having to call or visit the store to get a quote. Finally, I really like how all of the services
              they offer are talked about and explained throughout the website. If I were to implement any
              of their design principles to my own website, it would be always having forms of communication
              available on every page. That being said, the phone number displayed is not a link, and I believe
              making it a link would make the website more user-friendly.
            </p>
            <p><strong>What I Dislike: </strong>I am not a fan of the main image on the landing screen of this
            desktop view. It takes up too much space, and require the user to scroll to see any meaningful
            content. I also feel that the navigation font is a bit too small and I can see many viewers
            straining their eyes to read the links.</p>

            <h3>Mobile View</h3>
            <p><strong>What I Like: </strong> The
            first thing I noticed is that the hamburger navigation button is visible at all times with an opacity
            below 100%. This allows for content to be visible while the hamburger is overlapping it. I
            really like how much easier the navigation links are to read in the mobile view as well. Along with 
            the desktop view, finding forms of communication is very easy, and finding content and information 
            about the services provided are much easier than the desktop. I really like how the landing screen isn't
            as dominated by a picture as the desktop view. 
            </p>
            <p><strong>What I Dislike: </strong>The text could have been larger on the mobile view as I strained 
              my eyes to read most of the content.
