       Why I chose each component
--------------------------------------------

buttons: I chose to use buttons rather than links to navigate through my website because buttons are easier to style, and they have a clean style that does not take attention away from other conent.

toast: I used a toast message to display the rating for the Liquidation Center. I thought this would look neat on the top of the website when the user lands on the home screen, as well as display some meaningful content in one less click.
