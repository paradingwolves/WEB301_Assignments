       Why I chose each component
--------------------------------------------

carousel explanation: I implemented a carousel mainly to see if I could figure it out. It is also a cool idea to have a rotating set of images. I placed this at the top of the page so users would know what stores i am talking about

cards explanation: Cards were a relatively easy decision. They provide a nice and neat way of displaying content on mobile and desktop views.
