<p><strong>The Liquidation Center</strong> implemented <strong>adaptive design</strong> for 
  their website. Their navigation on the left side of the page turns into a hamburger menu,
  and the "featured items" are now the only items shown to the user on the homepage when the screens viewport 
  is less than 767px wide. The images that are consistent with the desktop and the mobile view 
  are replaced with smaller versions of the same image.
