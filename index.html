    <p>This is a decoration my grandma got me while she was in Mexico.
      It has my favourite hockey team's logo on it. This hangs up in my 
      bathroom and gives me something to look at.

    <p>I took a picture of this because it was next to me when I read the 
      assignment pdf (yeah, I know).
