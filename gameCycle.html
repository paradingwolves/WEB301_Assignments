<p><strong>Game Cycle</strong> implemented a <strong>grid layout</strong> for their website. 
  This website uses <strong>responsive</strong> design. There is no content that is not visible 
  from one view to another, only the way the content is displayed. At
  the <strong>992px breakpoint</strong> the website goes from a multi-column to a single column
  layout, and the hamburger menu becomes visible.
